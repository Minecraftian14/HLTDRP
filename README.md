If the <code>pretty-cute-little-title</code> fails to be satisfactorily informative or perhaps some grey matter just dont like electro pulsing through all possibilities, then here is a simple to read and omit description for this project:
  
This **special** and *totally not necessary* addon adds to the <ins>Already Super Cool</ins> Hyperlap2D an even more facinating feature, ie, simply giving silly reports and updates to your Discord to update it's Rich Presence regarding the user's activity like creating a new project, developing it, or if simply sitting blank before the marvelous Hyperlap2D!!!

Um... Do you know what is HyperLap2D? Oof... Sorry, I just never considered the fact that some of you might not know what it would be...

Well the simple link below will lead you to the incredible Hyperlap2D, starting with S going all the way through TUNNIN only to end with a nice little G!
