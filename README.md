#### Or in _short_ "HyperLap2D Rich Presence" Plugin.

<p>
If the pretty-cute-little-title fails to be properly informative or perhaps some grey matter just dont like electro pulsing, this "special" and _totally-not-necessary_ addon provides the "Already Damn Awesome" Hyperlap2D an even more amazing feature, ie, simply giving silly reports and updates to your Discord whether the user has created a new project, is developing it, or is simply sittong blank before the marvelous Hyperlap2D!!!

Um... Do you know what is HyperLap2D? Damn... Sorry, I just never considered the fact that some of you might not know what it would be...

Well here it is, starting with S going all the way through TUNNIN only to end with a nice little G!
